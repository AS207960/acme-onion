      <name>Introduction</name>
      <t>The Tor network has the ability to host "Onion Services" <xref target="tor-rend-spec-v3"/>
        <xref target="tor-address-spec"/> only accessible via the Tor network. These use the ".onion"
        Special-Use Domain Name <xref target="RFC7686"/> to identify these services. These can be used as any other domain
        name could, but do not form part of the DNS infrastructure.</t>
      <t>The Automated Certificate Management Environment (ACME) <xref target="RFC8555"/> defines challenges for
        validating control of DNS identifiers, and whilst a ".onion" Special-Use Domain Name may appear as a DNS name,
        it requires special consideration to validate control of one such that ACME could be used on ".onion"
        Special-Use Domain Names.</t>
      <t>In order to allow ACME to be utilised to issue certificates to ".onion" Special-Use Domain Names this document
        specifies challenges suitable to validate control of these Special-Use Domain Names. Additionally this document
        defines an alternative to the DNS Certification Authority Authorization (CAA) Resource Record
        <xref target="RFC8659"/> that can be used with ".onion" Special-Use Domain Names.</t>

        <t>The two methods already defined in ACME and allowed by the CA/BF do not allow issuance of wildcard

      <name>Client authentication to hidden services</name>
      <t>Some hidden services do not wish to be accessible to the entire Tor network, and so encrypt their hidden
        service descriptor with the keys of clients authorized to connect. Without a way for the CA to signal what key
        it will use to connect these services will not be able to obtain a certificate using http-01 or tls-alpn-01,
        nor enforce CAA with any validation method.</t>
      <t>To this end, an additional field in the challenge object is defined to allow the ACME server to advertise the
        Ed25519 public key it will use (as per <xref target="tor-rend-spec-v3"/> INTRO-AUTH) to authenticate itself when
        retrieving the hidden service descriptor.</t>
      <dl>
        <dt>authKey (optional, object)</dt>
        <dd>The Ed25519 public key encoded as per <xref target="RFC8037"/>.</dd>
      </dl>
      <t>ACME servers <bcp14>MUST NOT</bcp14> use the same public key with multiple hidden services.
        ACME servers <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> re-use public keys for re-validation of the same hidden service.</t>
      <t>There is no method to communicate to the CA that client authentication is required; instead the ACME server
        <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> attempt to calculate its CLIENT-ID as per <xref target="tor-rend-spec-v3"/> FIRST-LAYER-CLIENT-BEHAVIOR.
        If no "auth-client" line in the first layer hidden service descriptor matches the computed client-id then the server
        <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> assume that the hidden service does not require client authentication and proceed accordingly.</t>
      <t>In the case the Ed25519 is novel to the client it will have to resign and republish its hidden service
        descriptor. It <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> wait some (indeterminate) amount of time for the new descriptor to
        propagate the Tor hidden service directory servers, before. This should take no more than a few minutes. CAs
        <bcp14>MUST NOT</bcp14> expire challenges before a reasonable time to allow publication of the new descriptor
        (this document suggests at least 30 minutes).</t>

    <section>
      <name>ACME over hidden services</name>
      <t>A CA offering certificates to ".onion" Special-Use Domain Names <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> strongly consider
        making their ACME server available as a Tor hidden services. ACME clients <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> also support
        connecting to ACME servers over Tor, regardless of their support of "onion-csr-01", as their existing "http-01"
        and "tls-alpn-01" implementations could be used to obtain certificates for ".onion" Special-Use Domain Names.</t>

      <name>Certification Authority Authorization (CAA)</name>
      <t>".onion" Special-Use Domain Name are not part of the DNS, and as such a variation on CAA <xref target="RFC8659"/> is required
        to allow restrictions to be placed on certificate issuance.</t>
      <t>To this end a new field is added to the second layer hidden service descriptor
        <xref target="tor-rend-spec-v3" /> ยง 2.5.2.2. with the following format:</t>
      <sourcecode>
"caa" SP flags SP tag SP value NL
[Any number of times]
      </sourcecode>
      <t>The contents of "flag", "tag", and "value" are as per <xref target="RFC8659"/> ยง 4.1.1. Multiple CAA records may
       be present, as is the case in the DNS. CAA records in a hidden service descriptor are to be treated the same by
       CAs as if they had been in the DNS for the ".onion" Special-Use Domain Name.</t>
      <t>A hidden service's second layer descriptor using CAA may look something like the following:</t>

      <section>
        <name>Relevant Resource Record Set</name>
        <t>In the absence of the possibility for delegation of subdomains from a ".onion" Special-Use Domain Name as
          there is in the DNS there is no need, nor indeed any method available to search up the DNS tree for a relevant
          CAA record set. Similarly, it is also impossible to check CAA records on the "onion" Special-Use TLD, as it
          does not exist in any form except as described in <xref target="RFC7686"/>, so implementors must not look here
          either.</t>
        <t>Instead all subdomains under a ".onion" Special-Use Domain Name share the same CAA record set. That is all of
          these share a CAA record set with "a.onion":</t>
        <ul>
          <li>b.a.onion</li>
          <li>c.a.onion</li>
          <li>e.d.a.onion</li>
        </ul>
        <t>But these do not:</t>
        <ul>
          <li>b.c.onion</li>
          <li>c.d.onion</li>
          <li>e.c.d.onion</li>
        </ul>
      </section>
      <section>
        <name>When to check CAA</name>
        <t>If the hidden service has client authentication enabled then it will be impossible for the CAA to decrypt
          the second layer descriptor to read the CAA records until the CAAs public key has been added to first layer
          descriptor. To this end a CA <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> wait until the client responds to an authorization, and
          treat this as indication that their public key has been added and that the CA will be able to decrypt the
          second layer descriptor.</t>
      </section>
      <section>
        <name>Preventing mis-issuance by unknown CAs</name>
        <t>As the CAA records are in the second layer descriptor and in the case of a hidden service requiring client
          authentication it is impossible to read them without the hidden service trusting a CA's public key, a method is
          required to signal that there are CAA records present (but not reveal their contents, which may disclose
          unwanted information about the hidden service operator).</t>
        <t>To this end a new field is added to the first layer hidden service descriptor
          <xref target="tor-rend-spec-v3" /> ยง 2.5.1.2. with the following format:</t>
        <sourcecode>
"caa-critical" NL
[At most once]
        </sourcecode>
        <t>If a CA encounters this flag it <bcp14>MUST NOT</bcp14> proceed with issuance until it can decrypt and
          parse the CAA records from the second layer descriptor.</t>

          the correct validation response, they cannot compromise the integrity of authorizations as the response
          can only be used with the account key for which it was generated. As the validation channel for this challenge
          is ACME itself, and ACME already requires that the request be signed by the account, the key authorization is
          not required.</t>

        <name>Anonymity of the ACME client</name>
        <t>ACME clients requesting certificates for ".onion" Special-Use Domain Names may expose the existence of a
        hidden service on the host to unintended parties - even when features such as ECH
          <xref target="I-D.ietf-tls-esni"/> are utilised, as the IP addresses of ACME servers are generally
          well-known, static, and not used for any other purpose.</t>
        <t>ACME clients <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> connect to ACME servers over the Tor network to alleviate this, preferring
        a hidden service endpoint if the CA provides such a service.</t>

    <section anchor="use-of-id-dns">
      <name>Discussion on the use of the "dns" identifier type</name>
      <t>The reasons for utilising the "dns" identifier type in ACME and not defining a new identifier type for
        ".onion" s may not seem obvious at first glance. After all, ".onion" Special-Use Domain
        Names are not part of the DNS infrastructure and as such why should they use the "dns" identifier type?</t>
      <t>The CA/Browser Forum Baseline Requirements <xref target="cabf-br"/> ยงB.2.a.ii define, and this standard allows,
        using the "http-01" or "tls-alpn-01" validation methods already present in ACME (with some considerations).
        Given the situation of a web server placed behind a Tor terminating proxy (as per the setup suggested by the
        Tor project <xref target="onion-services-setup"/>), existing ACME tooling can be blind to the fact that a
        ".onion" Special-Use Domain Name is being utilised, as they simply receive an incoming TCP connection as they
        would regardless (albeit from the Tor terminating proxy).</t>
      <t>An example of this would be Certbot placing the ACME challenge response file in the webroot of an NGINX web
        server. Neither Certbot nor NGINX would require any modification to be aware of any special handling for
        ".onion" Special-Use Domain Names.</t>
      <t>This does raise some questions regarding security within existing implementations, however the authors believe
        this is of little concern, as per <xref target="security-id-dns"/>.</t>
